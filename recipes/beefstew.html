    <h1>Beef Stew Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/beefstew.jpg" alt="beefstewumai">
    <h2>A perfect hearty meal</h2>

    <p>This classic stick-to-your-ribs stew is the ideal project for a chilly weekend. Beef, onion, carrots, potatoes and red wine come together in cozy harmony. 
        If you are feeding a crowd, good news: It doubles (or triples) beautifully.</p>
        
        <p>For most types of stew, it takes time to develop great flavor. 
Stew uses collagen-rich, tough cuts of meat, which need at least two hours to break down. If you try to rush it and boil the stew, the muscle fibers will shrink and become tough. 
So give yourself a few hours to let it do its thing.</p>

            <h2>Instructions / Steps to Perfecting</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place meat in slow cooker
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix flour, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. 
                    Pour over meat, and stir until meat is coated.
                </li>
                <li>Add beef broth, carrots, potatoes, onion, celery, 
                    Worcestershire sauce, paprika, garlic, and bay leave; stir to combine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cover, and cook until beef is tender enough to cut with a 
                    spoon, on Low for 8 to 12 hours, or on High for 4 to 6 hours.
                </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Important to Note</h3>
        <p>This original recipe submission called for slow cooking on Low for 10 to 12 hours. 
            When making the video for this recipe, our food stylists found a cook time of 8 hours on Low (or 4 hours on High) was sufficient. 
            Please stir and check doneness along the way to be sure your meat is cooked properly.</p>
