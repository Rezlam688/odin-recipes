                    If your shrimp is frozen, thaw and peel before beginning. 
                    You can remove the tails or leave the tails on, if you prefer.
            </li>

Bring a pot of water to a boil for the fettuccine. Once boiling, add the fettuccine and boil until tender (7-10 minutes). 
Reserve a ½ cup of the starchy water before draining the pasta in a colander.
