Recipe project for Odin
This is going to be the first project for html I'm making via theodinproject lesson! By this point, I have fully understood html elements and tags that have to do with text and images. I'm going to be putting all the skills I've learned together to create a recipe that will hopefully jumpstart my work projects in coding and eventually, programming!
